The main goal of number theory is to discover interesting and unexpected relationships between different sorts of 
numbers and to prove that these relationships are true

Number theory is important for CP. Becurse.. Problems in competitive programming which involve Mathematics are are usually about number theory,
 or geometry. If you know number theory, that increases your ammo heavily in solving a lot of tougher problems, 
 and helps you in getting a strong hold on a lot of other problems, too.

 Number theory must learn topics:
