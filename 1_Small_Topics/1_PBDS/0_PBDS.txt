g++ compiler is a C++ compiler for GNU in Linux.

The g++ compiler also adds support for some special data structures that are not in C++ programming language standard library. 
These are known as policy-based data structures.
The policy-based data structures provide the programmer a high-performance, semantic safety and flexibility 
as compared to the standard data structures of C++ std library.

Hare are some good resource to learn about PBDS:

we have write some extra code when using PBDS:

#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;

typedef tree< ll, null_type, less_equal<ll>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update > ordered_set; 
/// change ll to any data type
/// less_equal for multiSet increasing order
/// less for set increasing order
/// greater_equal for multiSet decreasing order
/// greater for set decreasing order

/// couT<<*X.find_by_order(1)<<endL; // iterator to the k-th largest element
/// couT<<X.order_of_key(-5)<<endL;  // number of items in a set that are strictly smaller than our item
